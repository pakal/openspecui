# web-rendering Specification

## Purpose

Define OpenSpecUI runtime behavior for static export mode, including data loading, routing, and feature degradation.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Static Rendering Mode Detection

The web application SHALL detect whether it is running in static export mode or live server mode.

#### Scenario: Detect static mode from environment

- **GIVEN** the application is built for static export
- **WHEN** the app initializes
- **THEN** the system SHALL set a global flag indicating static mode
- **AND** this flag SHALL be accessible to all components

#### Scenario: Detect live server mode

- **GIVEN** the application is running with a live server
- **WHEN** the app initializes
- **THEN** the system SHALL detect server connectivity
- **AND** enable real-time features

### Requirement: Data Snapshot Loading

The web application SHALL load project data from a pre-generated snapshot in static mode.

#### Scenario: Load data snapshot on initialization

- **GIVEN** the application is in static export mode
- **WHEN** the app initializes
- **THEN** the system SHALL fetch `data.json`
- **AND** parse it into the expected data structures
- **AND** populate the application state

#### Scenario: Handle missing data snapshot

- **GIVEN** the application is in static export mode
- **WHEN** `data.json` cannot be loaded
- **THEN** the system SHALL display an error message
- **AND** indicate that the static export may be corrupted

#### Scenario: Data snapshot caching

- **GIVEN** data snapshot is loaded successfully
- **WHEN** navigating between routes
- **THEN** the system SHALL use cached snapshot data
- **AND** NOT make additional network requests

### Requirement: Client-Side Route Handling

The web application SHALL support client-side routing in static export mode.

#### Scenario: Handle direct URL access

- **GIVEN** a user visits a direct URL like `/specs/user-auth.html`
- **WHEN** the page loads
- **THEN** the system SHALL display the correct spec
- **AND** navigation SHALL work to other pages
- **AND** browser back/forward buttons SHALL work correctly

#### Scenario: Handle deep linking

- **GIVEN** a user shares a link to a specific change or spec
- **WHEN** another user opens that link
- **THEN** the system SHALL navigate to the correct page
- **AND** display the full content

#### Scenario: Handle 404 errors gracefully

- **GIVEN** a user navigates to a non-existent route
- **WHEN** the route is not found
- **THEN** the system SHALL display a user-friendly 404 page
- **AND** provide navigation back to the dashboard

### Requirement: WebSocket Subscription Stubbing

The web application SHALL safely stub WebSocket-dependent features in static mode.

#### Scenario: Replace subscriptions with snapshot data

- **GIVEN** a component uses tRPC subscriptions in live mode
- **WHEN** running in static mode
- **THEN** the system SHALL return snapshot data instead
- **AND** NOT attempt WebSocket connections

#### Scenario: Graceful degradation of real-time features

- **GIVEN** real-time update features exist in live mode
- **WHEN** rendered in static mode
- **THEN** the system SHALL display static data
- **AND** show indicators that data is not live

### Requirement: Visual Indicators for Static Mode

The web application SHALL clearly communicate to users when viewing a static snapshot.

#### Scenario: Display static mode banner

- **GIVEN** the application is in static mode
- **WHEN** any page is displayed
- **THEN** a banner SHALL appear at the top of the page
- **AND** the banner SHALL state "Viewing static snapshot"
- **AND** include the snapshot generation timestamp

#### Scenario: Style read-only interactive elements

- **GIVEN** interactive elements exist (checkboxes, buttons)
- **WHEN** displayed in static mode
- **THEN** they SHALL have visual styling indicating read-only state
- **AND** cursor SHALL indicate elements are not interactive

#### Scenario: Add timestamp to footer

- **GIVEN** the application is in static mode
- **WHEN** viewing any page
- **THEN** the footer SHALL display "Snapshot created: [timestamp]"

### Requirement: Base Path Configuration

The web application SHALL support deployment to subdirectories via configurable base path.

#### Scenario: Respect base path for routing

- **GIVEN** the app is configured with base path `/docs/`
- **WHEN** navigating between pages
- **THEN** all routes SHALL be prefixed with `/docs/`
- **AND** browser URL SHALL reflect the base path

#### Scenario: Respect base path for assets

- **GIVEN** the app is configured with base path `/docs/`
- **WHEN** loading assets (CSS, JS, images)
- **THEN** all asset URLs SHALL be prefixed with `/docs/`
- **AND** assets SHALL load successfully

#### Scenario: Support root path deployment

- **GIVEN** the app is configured with base path `/`
- **WHEN** deployed to the root of a domain
- **THEN** all routes and assets SHALL work without path prefix

### Requirement: Hosted API Endpoint Override

The hosted web application SHALL support hosted startup with an explicit backend endpoint supplied by the hosted shell.

#### Scenario: Use `api` query parameter for HTTP and WebSocket traffic

- **WHEN** the hosted web application loads with `?api=http://localhost:13000`
- **THEN** the runtime SHALL normalize that endpoint before React initialization
- **AND** HTTP requests SHALL target the supplied endpoint
- **AND** WebSocket subscriptions SHALL target the supplied endpoint instead of the hosted static origin

#### Scenario: Show connection guidance when no hosted backend endpoint is provided

- **WHEN** the hosted web application loads without a valid `api` query parameter
- **THEN** the application SHALL render a clear connection setup state
- **AND** it SHALL NOT attempt same-origin API or WebSocket connections to the hosted static domain

### Requirement: Session-Scoped Hosted Persistence

The hosted web application SHALL support a shell-supplied session identifier so multiple hosted tabs on one origin do not overwrite each other's tab-local browser state.

#### Scenario: Namespace tab-local state by hosted session

- **WHEN** the hosted web application loads with a session identifier supplied by the hosted shell
- **THEN** tab-local browser persistence SHALL use a session-scoped namespace
- **AND** another hosted session on the same origin SHALL NOT overwrite that tab-local state

#### Scenario: Preserve explicit global settings separately from tab-local state

- **WHEN** the hosted web application persists settings that are intentionally global
- **THEN** those global settings SHALL remain shared by design
- **AND** they SHALL NOT force tab-local drafts or panel state to become shared

### Requirement: Backend-Owned Embedded Pages

The hosted web application SHALL load correctly from backend-owned pages when embedded inside the hosted workspace shell.

#### Scenario: Load a backend-owned embedded page directly inside the hosted shell

- **WHEN** the hosted shell renders the backend-advertised `embeddedUiUrl` for an active tab
- **THEN** the embedded application SHALL boot successfully inside that isolated browsing context
- **AND** it SHALL use the supplied hosted backend endpoint and session identifier for that tab

#### Scenario: Embedded hosted navigation stays inside the backend-owned context

- **WHEN** the embedded hosted application performs client-side navigation
- **THEN** that navigation SHALL remain inside the embedded backend-owned context
- **AND** it SHALL NOT replace or discard the root hosted shell

### Requirement: Translation Settings Persistence Boundary

The web application SHALL treat translation preferences as global runtime settings while keeping document translation sessions ephemeral to the current view.

#### Scenario: Share translation preferences as intentional global settings

- **WHEN** OpenSpecUI persists translation enablement, target language, or translation display mode
- **THEN** those values SHALL be stored as intentional runtime settings shared across document-reading pages
- **AND** they SHALL remain separate from per-document translation session state

#### Scenario: Keep document translation session state out of global settings

- **GIVEN** a document is currently translating or already rendered in translated form
- **WHEN** the user navigates away or opens another document
- **THEN** the runtime SHALL NOT persist that document session state as a second global document truth
- **AND** another document view SHALL start from its own source-state session unless the user translates it explicitly

### Requirement: Hosted Translation Session Boundary

The hosted web application SHALL keep translation settings and document translation sessions scoped according to existing hosted persistence law.

#### Scenario: Hosted sessions share intentional global translation preferences only

- **GIVEN** the hosted web application persists translation settings that are intentionally global
- **WHEN** another hosted tab on the same origin opens a document-reading view
- **THEN** those translation preferences MAY remain shared by design
- **AND** the hosted shell SHALL NOT reinterpret them as tab-local draft state

#### Scenario: Hosted sessions do not share in-flight document translation state

- **GIVEN** one hosted session has an in-flight or completed document translation session
- **WHEN** another hosted session on the same origin opens the same or another document
- **THEN** the second session SHALL NOT inherit the first session's in-flight progress or rendered translation session state automatically

### Requirement: Static Translation Capability Degradation

The web application SHALL degrade translation settings safely in static export mode when runtime translation capability is unavailable.

#### Scenario: Static mode without browser translation capability

- **GIVEN** the application runs in static export mode
- **AND** the browser context does not expose usable translation capability
- **WHEN** the user opens translation settings or a translated document surface
- **THEN** the UI SHALL show translation as unavailable or limited
- **AND** it SHALL NOT imply live runtime initialization or download behavior that cannot occur

#### Scenario: Static mode with browser translation capability

- **GIVEN** the application runs in static export mode
- **AND** the browser context does expose usable translation capability
- **WHEN** the user enables translation
- **THEN** the UI MAY allow browser-side translation projection for the current static document
- **AND** it SHALL still respect the same global-settings versus document-session boundary

- [x] 3.6 Malformed placeholder output falls back safely
- [x] 3.7 Cache key includes source language, target language, placeholder topology, translatable attributes, and display policy version
- [x] 3.8 Cache service covers disabled mode, async write failure, clean, clear, and LRU cleanup
- [x] 3.9 Global settings tests cover read/write/default pruning
- [x] 3.10 Scoped web/core/server tests pass

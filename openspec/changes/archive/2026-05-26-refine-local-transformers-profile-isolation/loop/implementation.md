## Implementation State

- Status: implemented, locally verified, and latest PR checks passed.
- Current branch: `fix/file-panel-release-patch`.
- Current PR: <https://github.com/jixoai/openspecui/pull/171>.
- OpenSpec status: ready for user acceptance; archive and merge remain intentionally pending.
- Implementation proceeded as a platform-law refactor: server-owned profile/lifecycle truth, isolated profile folders, group-scoped sessions, global-only LocalModel/group selection, and page-owned translation lifecycle guards.

Implemented execution order:

1. Core schema and state model
   - Introduce profile manifest and lifecycle state types.
   - Add versioned group identity based on full resolved Git commit hash plus short display suffix.
   - Preserve raw repository request metadata as fetch-cache truth.
   - Mark old top-level model lifecycle fields as migration/projection-only or replace them where feasible.

2. Server stores and profile refresh
   - Add profile manifest persistence separate from local lifecycle state.
   - Implement refresh for the selected LocalModel only.
   - Resolve and persist full commit hash during profile creation.
   - Surface profile loading and profile parse failure states.

3. Isolated group filesystem layout
   - Add deterministic group root paths, including versioned group id.
   - Store/download all files for a profile inside that profile's folder.
   - Do not deduplicate shared files across groups.

4. Group-scoped lifecycle APIs
   - Change download, pause, resume, and delete to accept `{ modelId, groupId }`.
   - Key sessions by `modelId + groupId`.
   - Allow concurrent group downloads.
   - Implement group-folder reconciliation before read/resume.
   - Delete aborts related download/translation references and removes only the target group folder/state.

5. Settings and panel behavior
   - Make global settings the single source for selected LocalModel/groupId.
   - Remove project-config writes for selected local model/group where they are acting as authority.
   - Chip switching updates selection only and never recomputes unrelated group status.
   - Add refresh icon button to Local Model title inline-end.
   - Render Download Files revision metadata from server-owned `commitHash` / `revision` / `sourceUrl` truth instead of transient download log messages.

6. Translation lifetime hardening
   - Make `batchTranslate` use immutable runtime snapshot and scoped pipeline lease semantics.
   - Ensure deleting an in-use group aborts related translation work before file removal.
   - Add document translation generation ids and stale patch rejection.

7. Verification and migration
   - Add server tests before changing behavior where possible.
   - Add web tests for chip colors, refresh states, delete selection clearing, and document generation invalidation.
   - Run focused typecheck and tests listed in research-plan.

8. Legacy/mock profile truth cleanup
   - Reject persisted `legacy` profile manifests and fallback plan groups as concrete Local-Transformers profile truth.
   - Require historical fallback groups to carry a real commit hash before they can be projected into a manifest.
   - Project chip labels from manifest truth at read time: current commit labels stay concise, historical commit labels append the short hash.
   - Keep model/file sizes as structured fields for the UI instead of embedding size text into chip labels.

## Completion Evidence

- Local verification passed:
  - `pnpm format:check`
  - `pnpm lint:ci`
  - `pnpm typecheck`
  - `pnpm test:ci`
  - `pnpm test:browser:ci`
- Latest GitHub PR checks passed on PR #171 after the final CI-hardening commit:
  - Changeset Gate
  - CI Scope
  - Fast Gate
  - Browser Gate (`@openspecui/web`)
  - Browser Gate (`xterm-input-panel`)
  - Browser Gate aggregate
- Additional CI hardening landed during final verification:
  - Reactive watcher path resolution now resolves missing paths through the nearest existing realpath ancestor.
  - Missing reactive file/stat/exists dependencies now have a low-frequency poll fallback so a missed native create event cannot leave artifact status stale.
  - Core watcher tests await asynchronous watcher teardown.
  - Local model progress streaming test uses a controlled stream gate instead of a timing window.
  - Server Vitest now runs test files serially because server tests stub process-global `fetch` and start real local servers.
- Additional focused verification after legacy/mock profile cleanup:
  - `pnpm --filter @openspecui/server test -- src/local-model-asset-service.test.ts --runInBand`
  - `pnpm --filter @openspecui/server typecheck`
  - `pnpm --filter @openspecui/web exec vitest run src/routes/settings.test.tsx --project unit`
  - `pnpm format:check`
- Direct service projection against the developer's local cache no longer returns `q4 · legacy 30 B`; current profile chip labels no longer include short commit hashes.
- Additional focused verification after Download Files revision projection:
  - `pnpm --filter @openspecui/web exec vitest run src/routes/settings.test.tsx --project unit`
  - `pnpm --filter @openspecui/web typecheck`
  - `pnpm format:check`

## Decisions Taken

- Profile manifest data and local lifecycle state are separate facts.
- The application/API may use the separated shape directly; no artificial compose DTO layer is required.
- Profile versions are pinned to Hugging Face Git commit hashes.
- Full commit hash is stored; short hash is for display/folder suffix.
- Created profile downloads must use full commit hash as Hugging Face `revision`; `main` is only for search/refresh.
- Local profile folder/group identity is versioned, e.g. `q4-abcdef`.
- Old local profiles remain usable/manageable after refresh.
- `legacy` is not a commit hash. Cached manifests or fallback plan groups marked `legacy` are discarded from Local-Transformers profile truth rather than surfaced as chips.
- Current profile chips do not display short commit hashes by default; only historical profiles append the short hash to disambiguate them from the latest profile.
- No `stale` or `needs-refresh` lifecycle status will be added.
- Multiple group downloads are allowed concurrently.
- Deleting in-use groups is allowed, but it aborts related references/tasks first.
- LocalModel/groupId selection is global settings only.
- Page-owned translation tasks are aborted on page unmount.
- Settings changes affect the next `batchTranslate` call, not an already-running call.

## Divergence Notes

- Earlier discussion considered file-level reference counting for shared files. That is rejected. The approved design intentionally duplicates files per profile folder to maximize lifecycle isolation.
- Earlier discussion considered adding a composed panel DTO. That is not required. Storage facts remain separate, while API/application can use the separated structure directly.
- Earlier implementation patches attempted to fix chip color by changing frontend rendering and server projection. That path is rejected because it preserves competing state sources.

## Loopback Triggers

Return to intake/research-plan if any of these become true:

- Hugging Face metadata cannot reliably provide a full resolved commit hash for selected models.
- `@huggingface/hub` cannot download files at a pinned commit revision for the required endpoint/mirror.
- Transformers runtime cannot load from the isolated profile folder without reintroducing shared mutable cache state.
- A safe migration path from existing `models.json` cannot be implemented without losing significant user progress.
- Deleting an in-use group cannot reliably abort related translation work before file removal.
- Concurrent downloads create unavoidable corruption or race conditions in the chosen store format.

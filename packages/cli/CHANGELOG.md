## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 8ed4585: Move dashboard git refresh stamp into Git metadata (`.git`/worktree `gitdir`) so OpenSpecUI no longer creates `openspec/.openspecui-dashboard-git-refresh.stamp` in user projects.

  When Git metadata is unavailable, dashboard refresh becomes a no-op instead of writing a fallback project file.

  - add safer CLI export package resolution behavior and test coverage for local/dev package ranges

## 1.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 9b8d4bd: Fix SSG export package resolution by dynamically reading `@openspecui/web` from nearest `package.json` and treating local package protocols (`workspace:`, `file:`, `link:`) as local/dev mode.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 67d7d16: Finalize the dashboard live workflow iteration with stronger operational context and static parity:
  - redesign Dashboard top section into objective `Workflow Progress` + `Git Snapshot`
  - add git snapshot model/refresh lifecycle and compact diff-focused rendering

### Minor Changes

- Improve terminal interaction reliability, including InputPanel state persistence and ghostty virtual cursor behavior.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 7c7735b: Add OPSX compose workflow for change actions: actions now open a pop-area prompt editor with terminal target selection, copy/save-to-history controls, and send-to-terminal flow.

  Improve terminal input safety/feedback by surfacing write readiness and sanitizing generated payloads before dispatch.

  Enable InputPanel FAB usage on desktop while keeping touch-device keyboard suppression behavior.

  Refine compose dialog/editor layout controls and add route/navigation support for `/opsx-compose`.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a full pop-area based `/opsx:new` creation flow and unify terminal close lifecycle with callback metadata.
  - Replace dashboard/changes prompt-based creation with `/_p=/opsx-new` workflow UI.
  - Add advanced argument chips on `/opsx-new` while keeping official `new change` flags.
  - Extend PTY create/list protocol with `closeTip` and `closeCallbackUrl` metadata.
  - Execute close callbacks from a single terminal close path after process exit (internal route push or external URL open).

### Patch Changes

- Refactor OPSX config data flow to use a single `configBundle` subscription path.
  - unify config/schemas page schema metadata loading through one reactive bundle
  - remove deprecated split schema subscriptions from server and web hooks

  - Move static snapshot status from the top banner into the bottom status bar.
  - Keep static-mode status semantics consistent (`Static` instead of `Offline`).
  - Fix static OPSX data adapters so `/changes` and change detail artifact content render from `data.json`.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Release a minor version focused on platform reliability and search/productivity upgrades:
  - Add reactive search architecture with shared provider-based search engine and pop-area search UX.
  - Improve pop dialog lifecycle to make open/close behavior deterministic across routes and interactions.
  - Enhance CLI execution-path detection/config flow and related runtime diagnostics.
  - Improve terminal/session behavior and cross-platform compatibility, including Windows execution fixes.

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 74afc3f: Improve CLI configuration initialization and developer workflow stability.
  - Fix config persistence bootstrap by creating `openspec/` before writing `.openspecui.json`, so missing project config paths are no longer misreported as CLI-unavailable errors.
  - Improve dev workflow with a Bun/OpenTUI multi-tab `pnpm dev` experience and terminal rendering pipeline upgrades for PTY-style output, color-preserving display, and more reliable task lifecycle handling.
  - Fix Windows PTY startup defaults by resolving shell command from `ComSpec` (fallback to `cmd.exe`) instead of unix-only `/bin/sh`, and return structured `PTY_CREATE_FAILED` errors when PTY session creation fails.

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 74afc3f: Improve CLI configuration initialization and developer workflow stability.
  - Fix config persistence bootstrap by creating `openspec/` before writing `.openspecui.json`, so missing project config paths are no longer misreported as CLI-unavailable errors.
  - Improve dev workflow with a Bun/OpenTUI multi-tab `pnpm dev` experience and terminal rendering pipeline upgrades for PTY-style output, color-preserving display, and more reliable task lifecycle handling.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Improve CLI configuration reliability and in-app recovery flow.
  - Add strict `execute-path` behavior: when user-configured, it is used as the only runner candidate (no implicit fallback), so invalid paths are surfaced immediately.
  - Improve command parsing for `execute-path` with robust quoted/Windows-path handling and `command + args` persistence.
  - Unify config write path on `config.update`, keep `config.subscribe` as the single reactive config stream, and fix reactive config push after writes.
  - Upgrade the `OpenSpec CLI Required` modal to support inline `execute-path` input/save/recheck and auto-close on successful availability checks.
  - Improve dev workflow so root `pnpm dev` also watches and rebuilds `@openspecui/core`, with server dev watching core dist changes.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix CLI runtime PTY loading in `bunx`/`npx` installs by externalizing `@lydell/node-pty` from the bundle and resolving it from runtime dependencies.

### Minor Changes

- Improve terminal interaction reliability, including InputPanel state persistence and ghostty virtual cursor behavior.

  Enable InputPanel FAB usage on desktop while keeping touch-device keyboard suppression behavior.

  Refine compose dialog/editor layout controls and add route/navigation support for `/opsx-compose`.
